# Computer Vision Research and Implementation Repository

Welcome to the Computer Vision Research and Implementation Repository! Here, I embark on a journey to implement state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and explore various research papers in the field of Computer Vision. Each implementation is a step towards a deeper understanding of tasks such as image recognition, image segmentation, image generation, video generation, and more.

## Motivation

This repository is not just a collection of code but a dedicated effort to enhance my knowledge of Computer Vision. By diving into the implementation of research papers and SOTA models, I aim to grasp the intricacies of the field. Additionally, I seek to unravel the internal workings of several APIs that simplify our daily tasks.

## Objectives

1. **Learning by Doing:** Through hands-on implementation, I aspire to reinforce my understanding of Computer Vision concepts.
2. **SOTA Models:** Implementing state-of-the-art models to stay abreast of the latest advancements in the field.
3. **Task Exploration:** Delving into various Computer Vision tasks, including image recognition, segmentation, generation, and more.

## Contributions

Your meaningful suggestions and comments are not only welcome but encouraged! Feel free to share insights, tips, or recommendations that could propel me forward in this learning journey.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting adventure in the realm of Computer Vision! ðŸš€
